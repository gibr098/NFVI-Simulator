# NFVI Simulator
Parameters for running a NFVI with a Point of Presence can be set in the NFVI.config file.
Running App.java will build an NFVI with the desidered configuration

### Working on: 
1. Multiplicity constraints
2. Resources allocation/deallocation constraints
3. Functional part: Time slotteds service requests

### NFVI & NFVI-PoP
The Network Function Virtualization Infrastructure (NFVI) is a network of nodes, each virtualizing computation, storage, and networking, and able to host VNFs. Each NFVI node is called NFVI Point-of-Presence (NFVI PoP); it might belong to Internet service providers, cloud/edge operators, or simply infrastructure providers.The NFVI includes a virtualization layer that sits on the hardware with the objective of abstracting the HW resources. In this way, these can be logically partitioned and provided to the VNFs to perform their functions and ensure their lifecycle. To this purpose, NFVI contains all the essential hardware and software elements to run instances of VNFs and compose virtual Network Services.

### VNF
Virtualized Network Function(VNFs) are software implementations of network functions that can be deployed on a network functions virtualization infrastructure (NFVI).


### SFC
Virtual functions also work as building blocks that can be interconnected to implement complex Network Servicess. The traditional deployment of a NS requires data flows to pass through a certain fixed set of middleboxes in a specific order, with the aim of receiving some processing according to the functions they perform. This is described with the term Service Function Chaining (or simply service chaining), which denotes “an ordered list of instances of service functions”.


### COTS
A COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf) server is a readily available, all-purpose, standardized and highly compatible piece of hardware, which can have various kinds of software programs installed on it.

### Containers
The most traditional approach for virtualization is based on using a hypervisor, i.e. a middleware installed on a hardware infrastructure to run and monitor one or more virtual machines and the relevant usage of resources on the same physical devices. Hypervisors also supervise and coordinate the VM instances for efficient hardware resource sharing across them. However, other virtualization solutions can be adopted for VNF deployment: besides hosting VNFs inside VMs, they can run inside Containers.
